More information on me.

𝔳𝔦𝔢𝔩 / 𝔪𝔦𝔳𝔢𝔩𝔩𝔞

~ ----- ✦ ----- ~

I have major trust issues, BPD, severe loneliness, emotional detachment issues, and bipolar mood swings. I sometimes suddenly fall into a depressive episode and tend to distance myself a lot from people I know and even unfriend them, so I try to keep myself from friending others. I also hate making friends because I'm very used to being independent, and it's difficult for me to trust people.

Please don't interact with me too much. If you try to start a long conversation with me, it can make me overwhelmed and uncomfortable.

I frequently enjoy cuddles; it brings me a bit of comfort.

I sometimes have Touch Discomfort and/or Crowd/Cover Discomfort. Please respect my discomforts... Don't be an asshole and start rapidly booping me or covering me. (I find booping as an offensive gesture whenever I'm in a bad mood)

I'm usually afk because I'll always be on my phone or pc playing another game, so just send me a whisper if you want to interact with me. But, if I'm not interested, I won't respond to your whisper.

I have major trust issues, BPD, severe loneliness, emotional detachment issues, and bipolar mood swings. I sometimes suddenly fall into a depressive episode and tend to distance myself a lot from people I know and even unfriend them, so I try to keep myself from friending others. I also hate making friends because I'm very used to being independent, and it's difficult for me to trust people. (At very rare occasions, I do make friends. If you want to be my friend just whisper me or send me a friend request. If I don't know you that much or at all, I won't accept. (currently not accepting any friend reqs))

Please don't interact with me too much. If you try to start a long conversation with me, it can make me overwhelmed and uncomfortable.

I frequently enjoy cuddles; it brings me a bit of comfort. (If I don't have c+h in my name, it means I don't want anyone to cuddle with me)

I sometimes have Touch Discomfort and/or Crowd/Cover Discomfort. Please respect my discomforts... Don't be an asshole and start rapidly booping me or covering me. (I find booping as an offensive gesture whenever I'm in a bad mood)

I'm usually afk because I'll always be on my phone or pc drawing, watching yt, or playing another game, so just send me a whisper if you want to interact with me. But, if I'm not interested, I won't respond to your whisper.
